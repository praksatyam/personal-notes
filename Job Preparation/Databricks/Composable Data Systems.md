Bridging programming-language divides : 
- People fight for their language, battle royales. If this new tool doesn't support my language I don't want it?
- Why is this defensive nautre reasonable?
	- Context Dependent : **helps them do what they need to do**
	- Nomanclature click so analysts can think while coding
	- They work with each other, and check each others code, the computer can handle different languages.


What are composable systems:
- Paradigm shift in data system design: companies building their own systems.
- From coding first --> composing first
- composability allows anyone in a network to take existing programs and adapt or build on top of them, it unlocks completely new use cases that don't exist in our world. In other words: composability is innovation.

Standard vs Composable Systems

What is going on in the image?
	These are the three gluers : 
	1. Intermediate representations : standard way to represent query plans
	2. Connectivity : accessing databases
	3. Data in memory : format for representing in memeory

- "do-ers" & "gluers":
	- "do-ers" : tools, companies, documentations
	- "gluers" : core standards that glue the layers together.

Gluers are usually over looked and can cause bottlenecks. We need to be aware of the in depth representation and standards. Hence we have an **emergence of open standards**


When?
- Since RISC-style Database System
- [commoditization of query execution](https://ottertune.com/blog/2022-databases-retrospective)
- composability is soon to cause another major disruption to how data management systems
