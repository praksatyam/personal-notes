# Non-Function and Functional

- Functional Requirements : Input and Output. Should be able to make an API specification document using it. 
	- Output : What services a system should provide.
	- Input : How should a system react to inputs.
	- Not to Do: What a system should not do.
- Non-Functional Requirement : 
	- ==Scalability==—The ability of a system to adjust its hardware resource usage easily and with little fuss to cost-efficiently support its load. 
	- ==Availability==—The percentage of time a system can accept requests and return the desired response. 
	- ==Read Write Ratio== 
	- Performance/latency/PPP and throughput—Performance or latency is the time taken for a user's request to the system to return a response. The maximum request rate that a system can process is its bandwidth. Throughput is the current request rate being processed by the system. However, it is common (though incorrect) to use the term "throughput" in place of "bandwidth." Throughput/bandwidth is the inverse of latency. A system with low latency has high throughput. 
	- ==Partition-tolerance== -- 
	- ==Fault-tolerance==—The ability of a system to continue operating if some of its components fail and the prevention of permanent harm (such as data loss) should downtime occur. 
	- Security—Prevention of unauthorized access to systems. 
	- Privacy—Access control to Personally Identifiable Information (PII), which can be used to uniquely identify a person. 
	- Accuracy—A system's data may not need to be perfectly accurate, and accuracy tradeoffs to improve costs or complexity are often a relevant discussion. 
	- ==Consistency==—Whether data in all nodes/machines match.
