Parquet is a popular choice for storing and processing large datasets, but it’s not the only option available. Other file formats, such as **Optimized Row Columnar** (**ORC**), Avro, and JSON, also have their advantages and use cases. Here’s why you might choose Parquet over these other file formats:

- **Parquet versus ORC**: Both Parquet and ORC are columnar storage formats designed for similar purposes, such as big data analytics. They offer similar benefits in terms of compression, predicate pushdown, and schema evolution.
    
    The choice between Parquet and ORC often depends on the specific ecosystem you’re working in. For example, Parquet might be preferred if you’re using tools such as Apache Spark, while ORC might be better suited for environments such as the Hadoop ecosystem with Hive and Tez.

- **Parquet versus Avro**: Avro is a row-based data serialization format that focuses on data interchange and is used in various tools and frameworks, including Apache Kafka and Apache Hadoop:
    - Parquet’s columnar storage provides better compression and query performance advantages, especially for analytical workloads that involve aggregations and filtering
    - Avro’s simplicity and support for schema evolution make it suitable for scenarios where you need a more lightweight format and don’t require the same level of query performance optimization that Parquet offers
    
- **Parquet versus JSON**: JSON is a human-readable data format and is widely used for data interchange. However, JSON is not as efficient for storage and processing as columnar formats such as Parquet:
    - Parquet’s columnar storage and advanced compression techniques make it much more space-efficient and better suited for analytical workloads that involve reading specific columns
    - JSON might be preferred in cases where human readability and ease of use are more important than storage and processing efficiency
    
- **Parquet versus CSV**: Parquet files are smaller than CSV files, and they can be read and written much faster. Parquet files also support nested data structures, which makes them ideal for storing complex data.
