# 1. Random Wisdom:

HTTPs and HTTP
- HTTPS, through port 443, uses protocols like TLS/SSL to encrypt data, making it unreadable to anyone who might intercept the traffic
- Many websites now redirect traffic from port 80 to port 443 to ensure secure connections, but port 80 is still used for the initial request and often for redirection purposes
- HTTP over port 80 transmits data in plain text, meaning it's not encrypted.Â This makes it susceptible to eavesdropping and potential security risks.

CORS policy:
- Browsers Isolate environments
- Only fetch/call resources that follow within the CORS policy. Here this is mostly the headers that are blocked.
- Sandboxing and Security Restrictions
